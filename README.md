# BowlingGameExercise
This is an exercise to have a program calculate the final score of a series of bowling throws. This exercise was done in Java for no particular reason other than I have not used Java in a while. If needed this program can done in any other language requested. This assumes the throws will be given as an integer array and that we will be given a series of throws that would make up one complete game of bowling for a single person.
